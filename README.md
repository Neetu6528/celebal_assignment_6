#  NYC Taxi Data Analysis with PySpark on Databricks


##  Project Description

This project demonstrates how to load, process, and analyze NYC Yellow Taxi data using **PySpark** on **Azure Databricks**. It covers the full pipeline — from loading Parquet files, performing key data transformations, to running insightful analytical queries.

> 🗂 **Dataset Used:**  
> [yellow_tripdata_2018-01.parquet](https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2018-01.parquet)

##  Key Features and Queries Performed

###  1. Add a `Revenue` Column
Calculated revenue by summing:
fare_amount + extra + mta_tax + improvement_surcharge + tip_amount + tolls_amount + total_amount


###  2. Passenger Count by Area
Grouped trips by `PULocationID` to find areas with the highest passenger traffic.

###  3. Real-Time Vendor Earnings
Computed average fare and revenue amounts earned by each vendor.

###  4. Moving Count of Payments
Used window functions to get rolling counts of payments by each payment mode over recent entries.

###  5. Top 2 Earning Vendors by Date
Aggregated revenue, distance, and passenger count to find the top two vendors on any given date.

###  6. Busiest Route by Passenger Count
Found the most crowded route using `(PULocationID, DOLocationID)` grouped by `passenger_count`.

###  7. Top Pickup Locations (Last 10 Seconds)
Simulated a streaming query to identify top pickup locations using a 10-second window on timestamps.

##  How to Run the Project

1. Upload the Parquet file into Databricks (or connect directly via Azure Blob/ADLS).
2. Launch a Databricks cluster (11.3 LTS or higher recommended).
3. Import the notebook or paste code blocks from this repository.
4. Run each query cell-by-cell and visualize the insights.
